## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

**BEFORE DEPLOYING TO PRODUCTION:**

1. **NEVER use the default passwords** in docker-compose files
2. **ALWAYS create your own .env file** with strong, unique credentials
3. **GENERATE new JWT secrets** using: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`
4. **GENERATE new SSL certificates** - NEVER use development certificates in production
5. **Use proper SSL certificates** from a trusted Certificate Authority
6. **Enable firewall** and restrict access to necessary ports only
7. **Regular security updates** and monitoring

**SSL Certificate Security:**
- Development SSL certificates are in `.gitignore` and NOT tracked in git
- For production, generate new certificates: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes`
- Use Let's Encrypt or proper CA certificates for public deployment

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 with modern security practices
- **Backend**: Express.js with native WebAuthn implementation (primary) + Flask alternative
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with encrypted connections
- **Cache**: Redis for sessions and rate limiting
- **Authentication**: Custom WebAuthn server (no external auth libraries)
- **Security**: Native CBOR decoding, COSE key handling, crypto verification
- **Deployment**: Docker with Nginx reverse proxy and SSL termination

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/c39018084/yublog.git
cd yublog

# Run automated setup (creates .env, SSL certs, directories)
make setup

# Start all services
make up

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

### Option 1: Full Stack with Express.js Backend (Recommended)

The default setup uses Express.js with native WebAuthn implementation:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/c39018084/yublog.git
cd yublog

# Set up development environment
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Start the full stack (Express.js + React + PostgreSQL + Redis + Nginx)
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

### Option 2: Simple Setup with Express.js Backend

For a simpler development setup (no Nginx, direct port access):

```bash
# Use the simple composition with Express.js backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d
```

### Option 3: Flask Backend (Alternative)

If you specifically want to use the Flask backend for testing or development:

```bash
# Option A: Full Flask stack (isolated)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.flask.yml up -d
# Access at http://localhost:3001 (frontend) and http://localhost:5001 (API)

# Option B: Manual Flask setup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d db redis

# Then run Flask backend manually
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Frontend in another terminal
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**Access the application:**
- **Frontend**: https://localhost (nginx reverse proxy)
- **API**: https://localhost/api/health (nginx reverse proxy)
- **Direct Development Access**: 
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (simple setup only)
  - Backend: http://localhost:5000 (simple setup only)
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (development access)

### Development Commands

**🚀 Quick Development Workflow (Recommended):**

```bash
# Most common: restart with fresh code after making changes
./dev.sh                # Quick restart (default command)
./dev.sh restart        # Same as above
./dev.sh logs           # Watch backend logs in real-time
./dev.sh status         # Check service status
./dev.sh rebuild        # Full rebuild (when dependencies change)
```

**📋 Makefile Commands:**

```bash
make help           # Show all available commands
make setup          # Set up development environment
make up             # Start all services
make down           # Stop all services

# Development workflow (ensures code changes are picked up):
make dev-restart    # Quick restart with code refresh (recommended)
make dev-rebuild    # Full rebuild with cache clearing
make dev-clean      # Nuclear option: clean everything and rebuild
make dev-logs       # Show backend logs in real-time

# Debugging:
make logs           # Show service logs
make status         # Show service status and resource usage
make clean          # Clean up Docker resources
```

**💡 Development Workflow Tips:**

- **After making code changes**: Run `./dev.sh` (fastest)
- **After changing dependencies**: Run `./dev.sh rebuild`
- **If something seems broken**: Run `make dev-clean` (nuclear option)
- **To watch logs while developing**: Run `./dev.sh logs`

### Database Reset (Fresh Start)

To reset the database and apply the new security features:

```bash
# Reset database with new security schema (Docker)
./scripts/reset-database-docker.sh

# Or manually with Docker
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d db redis
./scripts/reset-database-docker.sh
```

DELETE /api/user/devices/:deviceId
```

## 📱 TOTP Authenticator App Support

YuBlog includes backup authentication via TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) authenticator apps as a secondary login method when WebAuthn devices are unavailable.

### Key Features
- **Login-Only Access**: TOTP can only be used for login, not account creation (prevents spam)
- **Industry Standards**: Follows RFC 6238 (TOTP) and RFC 4226 (HOTP) specifications
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, 1Password, and other TOTP apps
- **Backup Recovery Codes**: 8 single-use backup codes for emergency access
- **Encrypted Storage**: TOTP secrets and backup codes are encrypted at rest

### Security Requirements
- **WebAuthn Prerequisites**: Users must have at least one WebAuthn device before setting up TOTP
- **No Registration Access**: TOTP cannot be used to create new accounts (security measure)
- **Rate Limiting**: Protected against brute force attacks
- **Audit Logging**: All TOTP activities are logged for security monitoring

### Setup Process
1. **Register Primary Device**: First, register a WebAuthn device (YubiKey, Touch ID, etc.)
2. **Access Profile**: Go to Profile → Security Devices → Authenticator App section
3. **Setup TOTP**: Click "Set Up Authenticator App"
4. **Scan QR Code**: Use your authenticator app to scan the provided QR code
5. **Save Backup Codes**: Store the 8 backup recovery codes in a secure location
6. **Complete Setup**: TOTP is now available as a backup login method

### Using TOTP for Login
1. **Primary Login**: Enter your username on the login page
2. **Alternative Method**: If TOTP is available, you'll see "Sign in with Authenticator App" option
3. **Enter Code**: Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
4. **Backup Access**: Use backup codes if your authenticator app is unavailable

### Backup Recovery Codes
- **8 Single-Use Codes**: Each code can only be used once
- **Emergency Access**: Use when your authenticator app is unavailable
- **Secure Storage**: Store codes in a password manager or secure location
- **Regeneration**: Contact support if all backup codes are exhausted

### TOTP Management
```bash
# Setup TOTP (authenticated users only)
POST /api/auth/totp/setup

# Login with TOTP
POST /api/auth/totp/login

# Check TOTP availability for username
POST /api/auth/totp/check

# Get TOTP status
GET /api/auth/totp/status

# Disable TOTP
POST /api/auth/totp/disable
```

### Security Considerations
- **Encrypted Secrets**: TOTP secrets use AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Time Synchronization**: 30-second time windows with ±30 second drift tolerance
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 failed attempts before temporary lockout
- **Audit Trail**: All TOTP setup, login attempts, and modifications are logged

### Compatible Authenticator Apps
- **Google Authenticator** (Android/iOS)
- **Authy** (Multi-device sync)
- **Microsoft Authenticator** (Enterprise features)
- **1Password** (Password manager integration)
- **Bitwarden** (Open source option)
- **Any RFC 6238 compliant TOTP app**

### Recovery Scenarios
1. **Lost Authenticator App**: Use backup recovery codes
2. **New Phone**: Re-scan QR code or use backup codes to access account, then re-setup TOTP
3. **All Backup Codes Used**: Use WebAuthn device to login and generate new TOTP setup
4. **Lost Everything**: Contact support with account verification information

- Hardware-based authentication only
- Modern cryptographic standards (WebAuthn/FIDO2)
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Security headers and CSP
- Regular security reviews

### 🔐 Account Spam Prevention

YuBlog implements sophisticated device-based account spam prevention:

- **Device Identification**: Uses AAGUID (Authenticator Attestation GUID) to uniquely identify security keys
- **34-Day Cooldown**: Each device can only create one account every 34 days
- **Attestation Tracking**: Tracks attestation certificate hashes for additional device verification
- **Automatic Blocking**: Prevents rapid account creation with the same device
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear explanations when registration is blocked with countdown timers

### 🛡️ AAGUID Anti-Spoofing Protection

**Advanced Security Feature**: YuBlog implements industry-leading AAGUID spoofing protection to prevent sophisticated attacks:

#### How AAGUID Spoofing Works (Attack Vector):
1. **Packet Interception**: Attacker intercepts WebAuthn registration packets
2. **AAGUID Modification**: Modifies the AAGUID in the attestation object
3. **Cooldown Bypass**: Attempts to bypass the 34-day device registration cooldown
4. **Multiple Account Creation**: Creates unlimited accounts with the same physical device

#### Our Protection Mechanisms:
- **Attestation Signature Verification**: Cryptographically verifies that attestation data hasn't been tampered with
- **Certificate Chain Validation**: Validates attestation certificates against known manufacturer chains
- **Trusted Device Database**: Maintains whitelist of known trusted security key manufacturers:
  - YubiKey 5 Series (`149a20218ef6413396b881f8d5b7f1f5`)
  - Windows Hello (`f8a011f38c0a4d15800617111f9edc7d`)
  - Touch ID (`08987058cadc4b81b6e130de50dcbe96`)
  - Chrome Touch ID (`9ddd1817af5a4672a2b93e3dd95000aa`)
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Additional cryptographic device identification beyond AAGUID
- **Security Level Assessment**: Categorizes devices as high/medium/low security based on verification
- **Real-time Tamper Detection**: Detects and logs any attempts to modify device information

#### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// Enhanced device verification prevents AAGUID spoofing
const deviceInfo = extractDeviceInfo(attestationObject);
if (deviceInfo.securityLevel === 'high' && deviceInfo.attestationVerified) {
  // Trusted device with verified attestation
  await recordDeviceRegistration(deviceInfo);
} else {
  // Additional verification required for unverified devices
  console.warn('Unverified device attempted registration');
}
```

This protection ensures that even sophisticated attackers cannot bypass our spam prevention by manipulating device identification data.

### 👑 Admin Privileges

- **First User Admin**: The first user to register automatically receives administrator privileges
- **Audit Trail**: All admin privilege grants are logged for security monitoring
- **Database Trigger**: Automatic privilege assignment via PostgreSQL trigger

### 📊 Enhanced Monitoring

- **Device Registration Logs**: Track all device registration attempts and blocks
- **Audit Events**: Comprehensive logging of security events including:
  - Account creation attempts
  - Device registration blocks
  - Admin privilege grants
  - Authentication attempts
- **Security Analytics**: Monitor patterns to detect potential abuse

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### WebAuthn Issues:
1. **HTTPS Required**: WebAuthn requires HTTPS in production
2. **Browser Support**: Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
3. **Security Key**: Ensure your YubiKey/device supports FIDO2
4. **Domain Mismatch**: Check WEBAUTHN_RP_ID matches your domain

### Common Problems:
- **"WebAuthn not supported"**: Update your browser or use a compatible device
- **"Registration failed"**: Check browser console and ensure HTTPS
- **"Touch your security key"**: Press the button on your YubiKey when prompted
