### 3. âœ… Security Device Management System
**Problem**: Users could only register one device during account creation  
**Solution**: Comprehensive multi-device support with spam prevention

#### Backend Implementation (`backend-js/src/index.js`)
- **New API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/user/devices/webauthn/begin` - Initiates additional device registration
  - `POST /api/user/devices/webauthn/complete` - Completes additional device registration
- **Security Features**:
  - Same 34-day device restriction applies to prevent abuse
  - Device eligibility checking with AAGUID verification
  - Comprehensive audit logging for all device operations
  - Proper error handling and user feedback
- **Required Imports Added**:
  - `generateRegistrationOptions`, `verifyRegistrationResponse`
  - `extractDeviceInfo`, `base64URLDecode`
  - CBOR decoder for attestation parsing

#### Frontend Implementation 
- **WebAuthn Utils (`frontend/src/utils/webauthn.js`)**:
  - Added `WebAuthnError` class for standardized error handling
  - Created `registerAdditionalDevice()` function for complete WebAuthn flow
  - Proper error handling for device blocking, browser compatibility, user cancellation

- **Profile Page (`frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.js`)**:
  - Added "Add Device" button to Security Devices section header
  - Added "Add Your First Device" button for empty state
  - Added device registration modal with:
    - Device name input field
    - Security information about 34-day restriction
    - Loading states and error handling
    - Form validation and user feedback
  - Import statements for `Plus` icon and `registerAdditionalDevice` function
  - State management for device addition flow

### 4. âœ… Comprehensive PDF User Manual
**Problem**: No user documentation for platform features  
**Solution**: Complete user manual with PDF generation

#### Manual Content (`docs/YUBLOG_USER_MANUAL.md`)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**:
  - Introduction and key features overview
  - System requirements and supported devices
  - Step-by-step account registration process
  - Sign-in procedures and troubleshooting
  - Complete dashboard overview
  - Post creation and management guide
  - **Security device management** (including new add device functionality)
  - Account settings and security features
  - Detailed troubleshooting guide
  - Extensive FAQ covering general, security, technical, and usage questions

#### PDF Generation (`docs/generate_pdf_manual.py`)
- **Professional PDF Creation**:
  - Uses markdown, weasyprint, and pygments libraries
  - Professional CSS styling with proper typography
  - A4 format with headers and page numbers
  - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
  - Print-optimized formatting with appropriate fonts and spacing
- **Generated Output**:
  - `docs/YuBlog_User_Manual.pdf` (55.7 KB)
  - High-quality, professionally formatted documentation
